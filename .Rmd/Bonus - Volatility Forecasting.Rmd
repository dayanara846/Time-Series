# **Convert data into _time series_**

#################################  Convert data into time series  ####################################################################### 
setwd("C:/Users/ddaya/OneDrive/Data Science Portfolio/Quantitative Finance")
# import dataset
library(zoo)
StockData <- read.zoo("GOOG.csv",header = TRUE, sep = ",",format="%Y-%m-%d")
PriceData<-ts(StockData$Adj.Close, frequency = 5) # Frequency=5 because it is set on only business days

# Note:
#Frequency = 12 means that data is at monthly level
# Frequency = 4 means that data is at quarterly level
# Frequency = 6 means data points for every 10 minutes of an hour
# Frequency = 5 means that data is at daily level business day

plot(StockData$Adj.Close,type="l") # plots stock movement through time

```


*log the difference of the variable to get the percentage change*
```{r 2, include=TRUE}

# log and difference the variable
GOOGLE_Price<-log(diff(StockData$Adj.Close))
 library(zoo)
    GOOGLE_Price <- na.locf(GOOGLE_Price) # to handle NA values (from weekends and holidays)
plot(GOOGLE_Price, ylab="",xlab="") 
abline(h=0, col="dark grey", lty=3, lwd=3)


```


**Key Takeaway*: For the most part, GOOGLE stock performs at +2% -- +4% above average whenever the market has a positive shock. Similarly, it almost always performs above average, at about +1.5% -- +2%. Additionally, it has some very bad negative performance, at around -3% -- -4% when the market suffers a negative shock, but it immediately recuperates (by performing above average) the next day. 

**Diagnostics**
```{r 3, include=TRUE}
acf(GOOGLE_Price, na.action=na.pass)

```
```{r 4, include=TRUE}
pacf(GOOGLE_Price, na.action=na.pass)
```

**Note**: Our *ACF* portrays a non-stationary process. For an AR(p) model we need and ACF plot that decays slowly, and a PACF plot that cuts off after x lags; which would then lead us to conclude that the order of AR(p=x). We do not have any of those conditions, so we canâ€™t operate
an AR(p) model.

Our ACF decays slowly and ends at 3. Similarly, our PACF decays suddenly after the first spike, so it could be ARIMA(3,1,0) 


# ARIMA Model
```{r 5, include=TRUE}
ar3<-arima(GOOGLE_Price, c(3,1,0))
ar3

```
# GARCH Model

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(rugarch)

GARCH_Model<-ugarchspec(mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(3,0)),variance.model = list(garchOrder = c(1,1), model = "sGARCH"), distribution.model = "norm")

GARCH_Model
```
```{r 7, include=TRUE}
GARCH_Fit<-ugarchfit(GARCH_Model, data=GOOGLE_Price)
GARCH_Fit
```
  

__Notice__:

Based on the output, the estimated mean of the series is $\mu$=3.73786, and the estimated variance is $\omega+\alpha_1+\beta_1$=0.07028+0.07264+0.06565=0.20857


# Variance volatility series
```{r 8, include=TRUE}
# convert the fitted values into time series
library(readr)
    StockData <- read_csv("GOOG.csv")
      library(zoo)
          dt = as.Date(StockData$Date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
            Stockdataz = zoo(x=GARCH_Fit@fit$sigma^2, order.by=dt) 
```

```{r 8.2, include=TRUE} 
# view the first values of our new time series
              head(Stockdataz)
```

```{r 9, include=TRUE}
# view the last values of our new time series
tail(Stockdataz)
```

**Visualize our model**
```{r 10, include=TRUE}
plot(Stockdataz, xlab="", ylab="", main=" GOOGLE Volatility - GARCH(1,1)")
```

# Forecast
We will forecast the percentage change in GOOGLE stock for January
```{r 11, include=TRUE}
FutureForecast=ugarchforecast(GARCH_Fit, n.ahead = 20)
FutureForecast
```


```{r 12, include=TRUE}
     'Stock Price'<-as.data.frame(FutureForecast@forecast)
            `Stock Price`<-`Stock Price`$X2020.12.29.1
              plot(`Stock Price`, col='red', type='l')
                title("GOOGLE January Forecast")
            
```





Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
