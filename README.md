# Time-Series
Time-Series Forecast Alphabet, inc (GOOGLE) stock price using simple forecasting methods [which are embedded in the 'Forecast' package], ARMA, and GARCH models. By doing this, I show how to analyze time series and various methods to evaluate time series models. As a bonus, I also analyze the stock's volatility and forecast its future percentage change for the following month.  The code is partly based on Dr. Param Jeet's and Prashan Vats' book 'Learning Quantitative Finance with R'. I recommend it for those interested on learning more complex coding skills related to Quantitative Finance.
